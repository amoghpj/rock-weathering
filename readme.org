Continuous accelerated rock weathering by marine bacteria with enhanced siderophore production. Dalvie /et. al./ 2025.

The repository contains code to generate analytical solutions to the dual limitation model, and analysis code to produce paper figures.

* Requirements

* Instructions
- =src/steadystate.py= generates the analytical expressions for the steady state solutions.
  This script produces two other files
  - =model/dual_siderophore_independent_breakdown.py= contains the steady state solutions.
  - =model.dual_limitation_model.tex= contains the TeX code for the model definition.
- =src/figures.py= generates model simulation figures in the main paper as well as in the supplement.
